# control_systems_testing_environment
Test your controllers in real-time!

Welcome!

This environment was created in Godot 4.1.X
Using newer version might change it.

You can test control algorithms in this environmnent.
The idea is to use a rigid body node as a plant and make the environment
communicate with a Python program in real time. The control law calculations
happen in Python, where the inputs generated are fed back to Godot to control the system.

You are free to use, share, modify, expand the software as you please for free.
It comes with no warranty whatsoever. If one's project fails due to a bug in this program,
the creator of this environment is NOT RESPONSIBLE.

The creator of this environment is Mark Misin.
